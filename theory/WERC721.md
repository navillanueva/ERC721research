**Besides the examples listed in the code and the reading, what might the wrapped NFT pattern be used for?**

The example in the readin outlines how wrapping NFTs could be used in the scenario of "overthrowing" the founding team away and blocking their control over the NFTs and the royalties generated by them. In the code, it showcases how wrapped NFTs can be combined with ERC721Votes standard to create a governance token based on the underlying asset (in this case the NFT).

In addition to these, the wrapped NFT pattern could be used for :

- cross-chain interoperability: emitting a Wrapped version of the NFT in another chain different to that tokens native one.

- fractionalizing: NFTs with higher prices can be locked and divided into several wrapped tokens, allowing for a wider ranger of owners to invest and democratizing the product.

**Question: what more use-cases can be given?**
